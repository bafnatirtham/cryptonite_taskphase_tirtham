# CHAINING COMMANDS MODULE 11
This module will cover a few ways, aside from piping, that commands can be chained.

## 1. Chaining with Semicolons
1. The easiest way to chain commands is ;.
2. ';' separates commands in a similar way to how 'Enter' separates lines
(It is basically like ending statements. Once the terminal compiler encounters a ';' it considers the next line as the next command.

### Flag
`pwn.college{EWFvDXFLh2RQt-Y4aiEUu-kncY3.dVTN4QDL3kjM2czW}`

## 2. Your First Shell Script
1. When we combine many commands with `;`, the length can be very long.\
2. Therefore, to avoid this we can create a shell script with a '.sh' suffix and then run it as a file.
3. We can execute by passing it as an argument to a new instance of our shell (bash).
4. When a shell is invoked like this, rather than taking commands from the user, it reads commands from the file.
