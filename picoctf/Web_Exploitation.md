# PicoCTF
# Domain: Web Exploitation

## Challenge 1: Cookies

### A. Flag
`picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

### B. Approach
Step 1:
 1. In this challenge, we were redirected to a website where we could type the name of the cookie and search them. One hint was already given i.e. snickerdoodle
 2. I opened the Developer Tools > Application > Cookies and there was a table, with "name", "value", "domain", "path"
 3. There was a cookie called 'name' with the value -1 and as soon as snickerdoodle was searched it svalue changed to zero
 4. Then I entered a random number say 200 in the value section and then refresehd the page to check whether a cookie with that value was there or not. I continued searching using the Binary Search Technique
 5. This led me to total number of cookies (0-28) and then i started searching for each and every cookie, to get some hint; when I finally found the flag at value=18.

Step 2: Output

### C. Concepts Learnt
**1. Basic Info About What Cookies are**
Cookies are small files of information that a web server generates and sends to a web browser. They are used to:
1. Identify users and improve their web browsing experience
2. Remember your device, browser preferences, and associated online activity
3. Track your activity across websites

**2. Properties of Cookies**
There are various properties of cookies in a website:
1. Name of the Cookie
2. Value of the Cookie (or Cookie Number)
3. Domain of the Cookie (which site does the cookie belong to)
4. Path of the Cookie and more..

**3. Values of the Cookie changed helps in changing the cookie.**

### D. Incorrect Methods
1. First I thought to check the names of various eating cookies (since snickerdoodle is a real cookie).
2. Then instead of changing the values i tried to change the names of the cookie in developer tools
3. I was randomly changing the values of cookies, until i thought of binary search.

## Challenge 2: Forbidden Paths

### A. Flag
`picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`

### B. Approach 
1. On launching the instance, the website showed 3 files which on entering lead to the proses mentioned.
2. Using the information given:
   1. We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` (web root directory)
   2. the flag is at /flag.txt
   3. the website is filtering absolute file paths.
3. This information helped in knowing few crucial things:
   1. The files mentioned are living in the particular nginx/html/ directory, 4 sub-directories from `/`
   2. We have to use relative paths to find flag.txt, else we wont be able to access it
4. Using knowledge acquired from TP 1 (pwn.college), I tried Directory Traversal - Using relative paths to attempt to move out of the web directory
5. I used `../` (representing "move up one directory") to break out of the web root and access files outside of it.
6. Since we were 4 sub directories from / , I used `../../../../flag.txt` and clicked on 'Read' and it directed me to the flag page.

### C. Concepts Learnt
1. Directory Traversal: using `../` to move through directories
2. Brushing up and practical use of absolute and relative paths learnt from pwn.college

### D. Incorrect Methods
1. Using developer tools, network tabs, console tab and changing parameters over there to manipulate the page
2. Searching each and every file mentioned on the webpage, for the flag
3. one very silly mistake of only typing `/flag` and not `/flag.txt`

## Challenge 2: Unminify
### A. Flag
`picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_dbe259ce}`
### B. Approach
1. It was written that browser has succesfully received the flag
2. so i opened developer tools and tried to find any content there and the flag was hidden in the paragraph tag--> class attribute
