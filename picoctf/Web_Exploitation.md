### 1. Flag
`picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

### 2. Approach
Step 1:
 1. In this challenge, we were redirected to a website where we could type the name of the cookie and search them. One hint was already given i.e. snickerdoodle
 2. I opened the Developer Tools > Application > Cookies and there was a table, with "name", "value", "domain", "path"
 3. There was a cookie called 'name' with the value -1 and as soon as snickerdoodle was searched it svalue changed to zero
 4. Then I entered a random number say 200 in the value section and then refresehd the page to check whether a cookie with that value was there or not. I continued searching using the Binary Search Technique
 5. This led me to total number of cookies (0-28) and then i started searching for each and every cookie, to get some hint; when I finally found the flag at value=18.

Step 2: Output

### 3. Concepts Learnt
**1. Basic Info About What Cookies are**
Cookies are small files of information that a web server generates and sends to a web browser. They are used to:
1. Identify users and improve their web browsing experience
2. Remember your device, browser preferences, and associated online activity
3. Track your activity across websites

**2. Properties of Cookies**
There are various properties of cookies in a website:
1. Name of the Cookie
2. Value of the Cookie (or Cookie Number)
3. Domain of the Cookie (which site does the cookie belong to)
4. Path of the Cookie and more..

**3. Values of the Cookie changed helps in changing the cookie.**

### 4. Incorrect Methods
1. First I thought to check the names of various eating cookies (since snickerdoodle is a real cookie).
2. Then instead of changing the values i tried to change the names of the cookie in developer tools
3. I was randomly changing the values of cookies, until i thought of binary search.
